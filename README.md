## 🌳 Features Overview

This app brings together several powerful self-development tools in one place:

# 🧠 Memory Palace Builder

Welcome to the **Memory Palace** app — a visual, interactive tool to help you organize and recall information using the time-tested **Method of Loci** technique.

## 🚀 What Is a Memory Palace?

A **Memory Palace** is a mental model where you place information (like names, lists, concepts) inside visualized locations (palaces, rooms, landmarks). This technique boosts memory by anchoring ideas to familiar spaces.

This app lets you build digital memory palaces by:
- Creating palaces (collections)
- Adding rooms to each palace
- Uploading an image for each room
- Dropping pins on that image
- Annotating pins with names, notes, mnemonics, tags
- Walking through your palace in "Play Mode"
